# dyFbTool  
  
a node js tool can get video from dy share and post to fb page  
  
Douyin to FB reels ->  
idea :  
1.) i copy a link for a douyin video  
2.) app auto download the video and post to my fb page  
  
details idea :  
1.) maybe use discord/tlg as frontend -> so i can access on phone / pc  
2.) app goto douyin website and download the video down.. -> using F12 media function  
3.) post to my FB with description same as the DY video -> or able to customize..  
-> the description is only h1 element in the webpage.
