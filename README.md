# dyFbTool

a node js tool can get video from dy share and post to fb page

Douyin to FB reels ->
idea :
1.) i copy a link for douyin video
2.) app auto download the video and post in my fb page

details idea :
1.) maybe use discord/tlg as frontend -> so i can access on phone / pc
2.) app goto douyin website and download the video down.. -> using F12 media function
3.) post to my FB with description same as the DY video -> or able to customize..
-> the description is only h1 element in the webpage.
